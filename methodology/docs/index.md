# FASTR Methodology Documentation

## Introduction to FASTR

The Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports country-led efforts to improve the timely use of data for decision-making, ultimately leading to stronger primary healthcare (PHC) systems and better reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) outcomes. This set of initiatives and technical support is referred to as **Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience (FASTR)**.

### Why rapid-cycle analytics?

Existing health systems data sources are critical but often come with challenges that limit their use. Health management information system data may not be analyzed promptly or may be perceived as too low-quality to use for decision making. Traditional in-person household and facility-based surveys demand extensive resources and time, with long lags between survey design, data collection, and the availability of findings. This prevents decision-makers from using data to drive meaningful improvements in health outcomes. To fill this gap, the GFF supports countries to develop and use rapid-cycle analytic approaches.

### How does it work?

Rapid-cycle analytic approaches provide timely, rigorous, and high-priority data that respond to each country's specific priorities and data use needs. This continuous cycle of analyze-learn-strengthen-act seeks to improve the systematic use of data for decision-making towards improved RMNCAH-N outcomes.

### What support is available?

Four technical approaches, underpinned by capacity strengthening and data use support, enable the timely and high-frequency analysis and use of data. All approaches are customized to the country context and aim to support countries' priority policy and programmatic initiatives.

1. **Analysis of routine health management information system (HMIS) data** assesses data quality, quantifies changes in priority health service volumes, and compares trends in service coverage to country targets for priority RMNCAH-N indicators.

2. **Rapid-cycle health facility phone surveys** assess the performance of PHC facilities, monitor the implementation of reforms, identify the impact of shocks, and track changes over time. The phone survey is administered to a representative panel sample of PHCs over four quarterly contacts a year.

3. **High-frequency household phone surveys** provide a snapshot of care seeking behavior, foregone care, financial protection, service coverage, and patient experience of care. Household surveys are currently done in partnership with the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study.

4. **Rapid qualitative implementation research** approaches provide a deeper understanding of prioritized HMIS and phone survey trends (e.g., by explaining district-level performance variation or contextualizing the impact of health systems reforms).

Illustrative capacity-building activities include support to automate the extraction, cleaning, and analysis of routine data and support to institutionalize rapid phone survey data collection and analysis approaches. Data use support prioritizes the integration of rapid-cycle analytics into existing data review and feedback mechanisms at national and subnational levels to strengthen the systematic use of data for decision making.

## Use of Routine Health Management Information System Data in LMICs

Health-facility data collected through routine health management information systems (HMIS) constitute a primary data source for assessing the performance of the health sector. HMIS health data are widely used for a variety of purposes including health sector reviews, planning and resource allocation, program monitoring, health care quality improvement, and reporting purposes. Ministries of Health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are striving to ensure equitable access to quality health services and care towards attaining universal health coverage and other national strategies. The efforts can be more successful if decision making at all levels of the sector are well informed by timely, reliable, and comprehensive data gathered through a well-established health information system. Sound decisions are based on sound data; therefore, it is essential to ensure that the data are of good quality.

Poor-quality data impact various levels of the health system in different ways. For program managers, inaccurate data can lead to poor decisions that harm the program's operations and, ultimately, the population's health. At the planning level, poor-quality data can distort evidence of progress towards health-sector goals and hinder annual planning processes by providing misleading results. Additionally, when determining investments in the health sector, poor-quality data can lead to poor targeting of resources. Despite HMIS data being crucial for robust health systems, studies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have reported challenges with data quality, including issues with completeness, timeliness, accuracy, and consistency. These concerns about the quality of routine information have undermined its use in decision-making within the health sector. However, in recent years, countries have made substantial improvements in HMIS data quality which has been reinforced by a system of data quality assessment, data quality improvement, and data use for evidence-based decision making.

### What This Documentation Covers

This methodology documentation describes the FASTR approach to routine HMIS data analysis. The FASTR toolkit includes four automated code modules, each designed to streamline a specific component of the analytical process:

- [**Module 1 · Data Quality Assessment**](01_module_data_quality_assessment_documentation.md) - Automated assessment of HMIS data quality through completeness, timeliness, consistency, and accuracy metrics
- [**Module 2 · Data Quality Adjustments**](02_module_data_quality_adjustments_documentation.md) - Automated techniques for improving data accuracy by identifying and adjusting for data quality issues
- [**Module 3 · Service Utilization**](03_module_service_utilization_documentation.md) - Automated analysis of health service usage patterns to identify changes in priority service volumes
- [**Module 4 · Coverage Estimates**](04_module_coverage_estimates_documentation.md) - Automated methods for estimating service coverage and comparing trends to country targets
